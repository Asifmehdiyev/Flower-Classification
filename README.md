# Flower-Classification
Flower Classification with Deep Learning techniques
Deep Learning as subfield of Machine Learning, used for large scale datasets to identify and predict complex problems such as: Face Recognition,
Autonomous Cars, image classification and etc.

In this case, I used Deep Learning techniques (Fast AI) for image classification.

Libraries used for thise case:
Numpy - numerical python for numerical operations
Pandas - using dataset as dataframe
pathlib - API for working with files and directories
os - Pytjon module for interacting with underlying operating system
gc - garbace collector
fastai - Deep Learning library to work with large datasets
fastai.vision - All necessary functions within fastai
fastai.vision.all - All necessary functions within fastai
